Cool quotes then notes from Andrew Solomon at City Arts and Lectures yesterday :

Depressives can't move forward because they believe that their view of the world is correct.
They absolutely do not think they are seeing the world through a veil rather that the veil has finally been taken away.

Could this be the case for someone convinced of non-duality? The true and useless teaching of reality.
Could this be the case for someone convinced that non-judgement is always the correct action?
The action that genuinely and generally leads to less suffering..

Can these beliefs (these beliefs have been seen to) impede action.
They either need to be overturned or reconciled.

Arjuna must decide to start or prevent a battle with family members on either side.
His guru sits on the side he opposes.
At some point one must consider killing the teacher(ing)
